        Both sides of a successful call count. The result is the strong signal —
        a resolver shortlist, an OHLC panel, a filing index. The arguments are
        the weaker one, but a symbol the model handed to a tool that then
        succeeded has at least been exercised against a real system, whereas a
        symbol that surfaces for the first time in the final prose has been
        exercised against nothing. Failed calls are deliberately excluded, so a
        blocked or erroring call never launders an invented ticker.

        Bare symbol arguments are tracked separately as roots. Many tools take a
        bare ticker by contract, so a run that legitimately fetched ``AAPL``
        never writes ``AAPL.US`` into any argument or result. Without the root,
        the canonical spelling the rest of this module demands — see
        ``canonical_symbol_not_surfaced`` — would be the one spelling this gate
        rejects.
