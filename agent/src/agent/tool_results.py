"""Tool-result classification, target-path detection, and backtest archiving.

Extracted verbatim from ``src/agent/loop.py`` (issue #1624, roadmap item 3:
split ``loop.py`` along its existing seams). This module owns the module-level
helpers that judge a finished tool call: success/failure classification of a
JSON result envelope, detection of provider tool-call DSL left in final text,
the user-message target-file scan, ``run_dir`` normalization, and the
replace-not-merge archive of a successful detached backtest into the active
run. ``loop.py`` re-exports every moved name, so existing imports keep
working.

Behavior is unchanged: every function body, docstring, and comment moved
byte-for-byte; only the leading indentation of the module changed.
