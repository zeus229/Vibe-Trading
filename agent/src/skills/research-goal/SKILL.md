# Goal-Driven Finance Research

Use this skill when a user asks for a multi-step finance research task, comparison, audit, thesis review, or "keep working until the answer is supported." The goal runtime is for research only. Never use it to place, submit, or execute trades.

## When to Attach a Goal

Start a goal when the task has any of these traits:

- It needs multiple criteria before a conclusion is credible.
- It compares strategies, assets, regimes, or evidence sources.
- It may continue across turns or require a final audit.
- The user asks for "long driven task", "goal", "审计", "对比", "研究结论", or similar.

Do not start a goal for a tiny one-shot answer unless the user explicitly asks.

## Tool Flow

1. Call `start_research_goal` with a concise research-only objective.
2. Include 3-5 acceptance criteria when the user provided enough context.
3. Before continuing an existing task, call `get_research_goal`.
4. After a market-data lookup, backtest, document read, web source, or manual reasoning step, call `add_goal_evidence`.
5. Link evidence to a criterion using `criterion_id` or `criterion_index`.
6. Immediately before completion, call `get_research_goal` and use its `completion_contract` as the canonical map of criterion/evidence ids.
7. When all required criteria have been audited, call `update_research_goal_status`.

## Criteria Template

Use this shape when the user did not provide criteria:

- Define the research-only thesis and symbol universe.
- Collect fresh market, benchmark, or artifact evidence.
- Compare alternatives or a control baseline.
- Record caveats, contradictions, and the non-advice boundary.

## Evidence Rules

- Keep evidence short and concrete.
- Prefer artifact-backed evidence when a tool produced a run or file.
- Include `run_id`, `artifact_path`, `source_provider`, `source_type`, `symbol_universe`, `benchmark`, and `data_as_of` when known.
- Every `add_goal_evidence` call must declare `provenance_kind`:
  - `single_tool`: the note is backed by exactly one concrete tool result, including a structured error when that error is itself the finding. Copy that result's exact `tool_call_id`. If the runtime rejects it, choose only from the returned observed candidates; never guess from recency.
  - `synthesis`: the note combines multiple sources or has no single source tool call. Omit `tool_call_id`.
  - `manual`: reasoning or a note not sourced from a tool result. Omit `tool_call_id`.
- Never use a tool name, shortened alias, invented id, or "last tool call" as provenance.
- `evidence_id` values such as `ev_...` identify rows in the research-goal ledger. They are used by goal audits and are never grounding source refs; do not write `ev_...::field` in a figures declaration.
- `tool_call_id` preserves provenance but does not verify goal completion by itself. Completion still needs verified evidence from an existing `run_id` or an allowed `artifact_path` with a matching sha256 hash.
- Do not mark live trading instructions as evidence. Refuse or reframe them as research-only analysis.

## Completion Rules

- Use `update_research_goal_status(status="complete")` only after every required criterion has an audit row.
- Satisfied audit rows must cite verified `evidence_ids` from the same criterion in `completion_contract`.
- Never use grounding-ledger evidence ids as goal-ledger evidence ids.
- If completion returns a missing/mismatched audit error, use the returned `completion_contract` to repair the ledger/audit. Do not collect more web evidence unless that contract shows a required criterion actually lacks verified evidence.
- Use `status="blocked"` or `status="insufficient_evidence"` when evidence is missing, stale, contradictory, or not verifiable.
- Use `status="cancelled"` only when the user explicitly asks to end or discard the goal.

## Response Style

Tell the user what the goal is tracking only when it helps. Do not flood the answer with ledger details. Lead with the research conclusion, then mention which criteria remain unresolved.
