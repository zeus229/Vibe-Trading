"""Standalone WebSocket channel probe — local validation, no remote endpoint.

WebSocket is a *server* channel: vibe-trading listens and clients connect, so
there are no remote credentials to validate against a token endpoint (cf.
:mod:`src.channels.token_probe`). Instead this probe checks the two things
that make :meth:`WebSocketChannel.start` fail in practice:

1. **SSL material** — when ``ssl_certfile`` / ``ssl_keyfile`` are set, the
   cert/key pair must load into a server ``SSLContext`` (same construction as
   the adapter's ``_build_ssl_context``). A missing or malformed file is
   ``invalid_credentials``: it is bad local secret material, not a network
   problem.
2. **Address availability** — a read-only TCP bind of ``host:port`` that
    mirrors what ``serve()`` (via ``loop.create_server``) will do: every
    unique resolved address is bound and held simultaneously (e.g.
    ``localhost`` → ``::1`` + ``127.0.0.1``), with ``SO_REUSEADDR`` set only
    where ``create_server`` sets it (POSIX, non-cygwin — on Windows the flag
    would let the probe bind an occupied port and report a false ``ok``).
    The honest semantics of ``EADDRINUSE``: while this channel is *running*
    the address is legitimately occupied by us, so a plain bind would report
    a false negative on exactly the hot-config Test click the probe exists
    for. The probe therefore follows an ``EADDRINUSE`` with a plain TCP
    connect: a listening server answers (ok, with an explanatory detail),
    while a held but non-listening address does not (``network``).

When ``unix_socket_path`` is set, ``start()`` ignores host/port entirely and
mkdirs the parent + unlinks a stale socket before binding — side effects a
read-only probe must never perform — so the bind check is skipped and only
the SSL material is validated.

The probe performs no filesystem writes, creates no directories and unlinks
nothing. Details are scrubbed of ``token`` / ``token_issue_secret``
defensively (cert/key *paths* may appear: they are not secrets) and bounded
to 200 characters.
