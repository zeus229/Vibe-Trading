    Uses exactly the same per-position ``market_value_native`` and

    aggregate (see ``vibe_portfolio.py`` on the Asistente Casa side) — no
    price or daily-change recomputation, no extra PPI/Yahoo call. Computed
    over every position in ``holdings_native`` (all currencies, all 40+
    holdings) before the result is truncated for delivery, so the ranking is
    never biased toward whichever positions happen to survive the cut.

    ``contribution_pp`` renormalizes the weight over only the positions with
    ``daily_change_status == "ready"`` (not the whole portfolio), so
    ``sum(contribution_pp)`` reproduces ``daily_change.pct`` even when

    valid figure.
