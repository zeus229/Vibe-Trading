"""Convert additive qfq series to the multiplicative (ratio) convention.

A-share forward-adjusted prices from Tencent, Eastmoney and AKShare are
dividend-ADDITIVE: between corporate actions ``qfq - raw`` is a constant
offset, and each down-step at an ex-date is the cash dividend per share
(HKUDS/Vibe-Trading#1541). A return computed on those levels is not a total
return (the owner measured 600519.SH 2019 buy-and-hold at +184.07% additive
against +100.43% multiplicative), and old levels can even go negative.

The offsets are enough to recover the multiplicative series: at each step the
factor is ``(prev_raw_close - dividend) / prev_raw_close``, and the cumulative
product scales raw bars onto the 前复权 ratio basis, the same convention
``cn_adjust.apply_qfq`` uses for Tushare factors. Two consequences of the
construction to know before reading levels off the result:

- The series is anchored at the window's END (bars after the last in-window
  action keep ratio 1), so absolute levels depend on the requested range;
  returns are unaffected. Windows that cross a 送转 (bonus-share) event have
  offsets that drift with the price level by construction, and this module
  refuses them rather than converting on a wrong basis.
- A window with no corporate action inside it has nothing to convert; the
  caller keeps today's series and its static stamp instead of an identity
  relabel.

Any inconsistency (misaligned calendars, offsets that are not plateaus, a
non-positive or oversized dividend) returns ``None`` so the caller keeps the
additive series, stamp and warning instead of shipping a bad conversion.
