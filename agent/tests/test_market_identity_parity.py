"""Every market the data layer routes is known to identity and symbol search (#1565).

A market is added in ``backtest.engines._market_hooks`` (pattern + currency) and
the backtest can then price it. The grounding identity layer and symbol search
keep their own suffix tables, and nothing tied them to that one: ``.L``, ``.VN``
and ``.BA`` each shipped with no canonical-symbol scan, no venue, no currency,
and search results labelled ``global``. This test makes the backtest's currency
table the list, so a new market fails here until it has a row.
